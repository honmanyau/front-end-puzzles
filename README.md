## Front-end Puzzles

> A collection of front-end development puzzles

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of puzzles that I created for exploring and practising front-end development techniques. The motivation for creating these puzzles is because I have been thinking about them for a while, and something  ~~like not passing a front-end development interview~~ gave me that final push.

Most of the puzzles are self-contained and are designed to emulate practical front-end development problems that require solid knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to solve. More detail can be found in each of the puzzles.
